## Connect SQL and R

we select crime data frame from ChicagoCrime.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(DBI)
library(dbplyr)
library(odbc)

# odbcListDrivers()

con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc(),
                      Driver = "SQL Server",
                      Server = "mcobsql.business.nd.edu",
                      UID = "MSBAstudent",
                      PWD = "SQL%database!Mendoza",
                      Port = 3306, 
                      Database = "ChicagoCrime")

# dbListFields(con, "crimes")

# select_q <- dbSendQuery(
#   conn = con, 
#   statement = "SELECT * from crimes"
# )
# 
# select_res <- dbFetch(select_q)
# 
# dbClearResult(select_q)

selected <- dbSendQuery(
  conn = con, 
  statement = "SELECT * from crimes"
)

crime <- dbFetch(selected)
```

## Question 1 

We all know Chicago is a dangerous city, depends on that, we can to discover which ward Chicago will have lowest crime happen. So that people can choose these ward for visit or travel. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
load("data/chicago_crime.RData")
crime_count_by_ward <- aggregate(id ~ ward, select_res, length)
colnames(crime_count_by_ward) <- c("ward", "count")
crime_count_by_ward <- crime_count_by_ward[order(crime_count_by_ward$count), ]
top_10_safest_wards <- tail(crime_count_by_ward, 10)

ggplot(top_10_safest_wards, aes(x=reorder(ward, -count), y=count, fill=ward)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="black") +  
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Top 10 Safest Wards in Chicago",
       x="Ward",
       y="Number of Crimes") +
  theme_minimal() +  
  theme(legend.position="none")
```
